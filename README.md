------------------
**Color Mapping:**<br/>
------------------
The Color Mapping filter allows to apply any 8-color palette to an input image.
The current version has the following features:
<ul>
  <li>Edit and save any custom palette.</li>
  <li>Palette generation using linear gradient between any 2 colors.</li>
  <li>Palette extraction from any image by using k-means algorithm (tones from image).</li>
  <li>Color mapping modes: Fuzzy, Euclidean, and Light-based.</li>
  <li>The Fuzzy mode allows to adjust the "weight" of each color during mapping, which the user can adjust with the sliders.</li>
</ul>

Here is an example of color Mapping using an image I took in Oslo:
