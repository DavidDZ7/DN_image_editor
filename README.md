------------------
**Color Mapping:**<br/>
------------------
The Color Mapping filter allows to apply any 8-color palette to an input image.
The current version has the following features:
<ul>
  <li>Edit and save any custom palette to the palette database.</li>
  <li>Palette generation based on a linear gradient between any two colors.</li>
  <li>Palette extraction from any image using the k-means algorithm (tones from image).</li>
  <li>Color mapping modes: Fuzzy, Euclidean, and Light-based.</li>
  <li>The Fuzzy mode allows the user to adjust the "weight" of each color during mapping by moving the sliders.</li>
</ul>

Here is an example of color Mapping using a photo I took in Oslo:
